        The most important thing in the world is <br>family and love <br>
        It's the group of people who are there for you through thick and thin,who love you unconditionally,
    </p>
    <p>
        My <br>family is the best <br>
        My family can include my siblings,grandparent,aunts,uncles,cousins,or any other close relatives
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing bloodlines doesn't blood families together, <br> love does
        choosing to be a family together takes far more strengths and love
        than genetics
